Hello im Aryan Paode from grade 7 in Nahar International School. im makeing my first website on html. 


This is to help people to understand about both categories of games (indoor and outdoor games) along with their examples.<br>

OUTDOOR SPORTS:<br>
Outdoor games are the athletic or sporting games that involves physical activity and are generally played outside in the open. Generally, there is a spirit of healthy competition in outdoor games. Some examples includes lawn-tennis, football, cricket, hockey, soccer, etc.

Why should we play? We play by nature. We have an instinct to play as we have an instinct to work. We work in serious mood and play in light mood. So, play and work are complementary to each other.

Man cannot always be in serious mood. He sometimes requires relaxation. Outdoor games give that relaxation. We have to play outdoor games to recharge the battery of energy. The proverb goes – all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.

Outdoor games have a great role to play in our life.

Outdoor games such as football, swimming, soccer, golf, cricket, etc. are necessary for our physical fitness.<br>
Sporty spirit helps us tide overt the pangs of life.
Outdoor games played on national level foster national integration.
They are the connecting bridges among the nations and lay the foundation of international understanding and universal brotherhood.
Olympic Games enhance the national prestige of medal winning countries highly.
Outdoor games and sports in educational institutions: Every educational institution has to arrange for outdoor games and sports for its students. Many schools have their own play ground. We generally encourage our girls and boys to become good engineers or doctors but seldom to become a good footballer.<br>

SO we have seen the importance of outdoor games... but indoor games have their own facts as well.<br>
Playing sports is a great way to exercise and keep your body fit and healthy. But oftentimes your regular sports dates with friends are interrupted by weather conditions. You are forced to cancel a weekend game due to rain, or you sometimes elect not to play because being exposed to the sun’s rays could cause skin damage. Playing indoor sports allows you to play regularly without worrying about the rain or the damaging effect of the sun on your health.

When the game is finished, you can join friends and family for some socialising over a cup of coffee in an environment of comfort and even temperature. Seeing how comfortable and safe it is to play indoors could perhaps encourage your family and friends to join an indoor sports club. They too, will experience the benefits of playing indoor sports
