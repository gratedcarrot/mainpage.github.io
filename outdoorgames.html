<h4>WE have seen what outdoor games are and we will look at the examples of them i have chosen two of the most famous outdoor games:</h><br>

Football is a game where there are 2 teams of 11 players attempting to shoot a ball into the enemy's goal and score a point
The time of a football match is 90 minutes, although it's customary for the match official to add time on to the end of each half if there were prolonged stoppages or delays during the run of play. In tournament situations where a winner must be declared, if a match is tied after 90 minutes, there will be two extra periods of 15 minutes each played. If the score remains tied, a penalty shootout will decide the winner. the team with more goals wins the game.<br> <br>
